## üìñ Description

New armors for vanilla minecraft! The new armors are `Fire`, `Ender`, `Prismarine`, `Dune` and `Sculk` armors, these new armors do not seek to create a tier more powerful than the netherite, they seek to add armors that modify other attributes so you can choose the armor that best suits your play style, that is, they are alternatives to the netherite armor.

When a player obtains a diamond, they unlock all armor recipes

## ‚öîÔ∏è Armors, Stats and Recipes

All armors durability is the same as the diamond armor set, and the armor and armor toughness is an intermediate between iron armor and diamond armor.
